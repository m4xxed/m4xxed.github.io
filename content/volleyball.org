* Volleyball

** 5-1 system

*** Legend / Position Names

| O  | Outside Hitter  |
| M  | Middleblock     |
| OP | Opposite Hitter |
| S  | Setter          |
| L  | Libera:o        |

*** Starting Positions

These are the starting positions (with *S* being on position 1) for
all players, including positional numbers.

#+caption: Starting positions on *S_{1}*

_Important:_
- *O1/2* start diagonally to each other
- *M1/2* start diagonally to each other
- *S* and *OP* start diagonally to each other

*** Base Positions

The 6 different rotations can be split into the two groups:
- *S* starts in the back row, on positions 1/5/6
- *S* starts in the front row, on positions 4/3/2


For every scenario we have defined target positions (where you want to
end up after switching), independently of how one starts in the
serving and receiving rotation.

**** With setter in the back court (Positions: 1,6,5)

#+attr_latex: :float t
#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_LÃ¤ufer-Zielpositionen.png]]

- *S* starts in the back court, so they are not allowed to
  block/attack from the front court above the net

- as soon as the ball was received, *S* moves to position "2.5"
  (between 2 and 3) so they can set

- as soon as the ball passes the net, *S* switches positions with *OP*
  so *OP* can block and *S* secure the block / defend

- if *S* have to defend / receive, *OP* (or any other position) have
  to temporarily step up as setter

**** With setter in the front court (Positions:4,3,2)

#+attr_latex: :float t
#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Wechsel-Zielpositionen.png]]

- *S* started in the front court, so they can actively attack / block

- *OP* starts in the back court, so can only do back attacks

*** Game Scenarios

The following scenarios are listed in the order that they will appear
during a game.

The most complicated scenarios are the *S_{1}*, *S_{6}*, *S_{5}*,
because *S* and *OP* have to continually switch positions.

**** Setter on position 1 (Service)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z1-Angabe.png]]

- immediately after the serve, *S* has to secure the block behind *OP*

**** Setter on position 1 (Receive)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z1-Annahme.png]]

- *M2* have to ensure that they do not block the view of the receiving
  parties

- *O1* move backwards for the first receive, and *S* has to ensure
  that they remain behind *O1*

- *S* does not have to receive, but has to get to their position "2.5"
  right after the receive

- exceptionally, *O1* and *OP* are not on their goal positions

**** Setter on position 6 (Service)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z6-Angabe.png]]

- *S* does not have to ensure staying behind *O2*, because *O2* is out
  of court for the serve

- *L* can immediately move to position 5

- *O1* moves to defend on position 6 immediately after serving

**** Setter on position 6 (Receive)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z6-Annahme.png]]

_Attention_:
- *S* can not start before *OP*
- *S* has to start right of *L* and left of *O1*

- *M2* and *OP* move to the right to ensure a clear view for the
  receiving parties and so that *S* is as close to position "2.5" as
  possible

**** Setter on position 5 (Service)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z5-Angabe.png]]

- *S* and *O1* stand close to the center, a bit rightbound, so that
  *S* can quickly secure the block

**** Setter on position 5 (Receive)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z5-Annahme.png]]

- *O2* moves from 3 to 5 to fill in with the receiving

- *S* needs to be faaaaast (if the receivers are kind, they will receive very high)

- *O2*, *O1* and *L* switch after successful receive

- And yes, *S* /could/ start further towards the center (left of position 6),
  but that would impede the clear view for the receivers...

**** Setter on position 4 (Service)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z4-Angabe.png]]

... simple af ...

**** Setter on position 4 (Receive)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z4-Annahme.png]]

- *O2* shifts all the way from position 2 to 5, which is why *M1* and
  *S* have to shift all the way to the left

- *O2* cannot start behind *OP*, which is why *OP* moves all the way
  back

- *OP* is freed from the heavy duty of receiving

**** Setter on position 3 (Service)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z3-Angabe.png]]

 ... also simple af ...

**** Setter on position 3 (Receive)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z3-Annahme.png]]

- *O1* moves back to receiving (but has to remain in front of *L*)

- *L* shifts to target position 6 for receiving

**** Setter on position 2 (Service)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z2-Angabe.png]]

... so simple ...

**** Setter on position 2 (Receive)

#+attr_org: :width 450
[[file:./assets/system-5-1/System-5-1_Z2-Annahme.png]]

... do I even need to say it? ...
